# Map and Tile Design

The first map that I created on MapBox and then connected with on QGIS was a basemap that was a preset dark theme simple basemap from MapBox, but I edited parts of it such as country borders, county borders, and building views. I also changed the opacity of the building colors to make it more visually pleasing to a dense city such as Seattle. An image of this basemap is below.

The second map that I created was used by downloading and importing data from the City of Seattle Open Data Portal. I filtered a dataset that contains crime data in Seattle from 2008-Present so that it would include just crimes recorded so far in 2023. I used a brighter theme for this map to make it easier to visualize the crime locations that I mapped since they are represented by black dots. This is my group's final project theme so I decided to use some of the data that we will be using. This map can be seen below.
