# Map and Tile Design

The first map that I created on MapBox and then connected with on QGIS was a basemap that was a preset dark theme simple basemap from MapBox, but I edited parts of it such as country borders, county borders, and building views. I also changed the opacity of the building colors to make it more visually pleasing to a dense city such as Seattle. An image of this basemap is below.

The second map that I created was used by downloading and importing data from the City of Seattle Open Data Portal. I filtered a dataset that contains crime data in Seattle from 2008-Present so that it would include just crimes recorded so far in 2023. I used a darker background so that the heatmap aspects would be more presentational. An image of this map is below.

The third map that I created was produced on QGIS by layering the basemap and the heatmap on top of each other to produce an effective visualization that shows how crime is distributed throughout the City of Seattle. An image of this map is below.
